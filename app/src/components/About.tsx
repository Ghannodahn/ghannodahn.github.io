      <h2>The Role of the Caretaker</h2>
      <p>
        As Ghannodahn, I have been entrusted with the maintenance and expansion of this vast collection.
        My purpose is to guide seekers to the knowledge they require, while preserving the integrity
        of the information contained within these metaphysical walls.
